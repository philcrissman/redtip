Redtip
======

Redtip is a simple javascript based tooltip helper for rails. It is based heavily on the Redbox plugin, but modified for this purpose rather than with the centered window. The css for the tips can be adjusted to suit your taste, you'll find it in redtip.css.

Credits
=======

This was based heavily (very heavily) on Redbox, which in turn credits:

Much of the design, and some of the javascript and css are shamelessly ripped from the Thickbox library, by Cody Lindley. 

This library should be considered to be a derivative work of Thickbox, and is also released under the MIT licence.

Usage
=====

Examine the public methods of redtip_helper.rb. They will all look familiar, much like the existing link helpers, except that they work with redtips. You should not need to interact with the javascript directly.

Redtip provides one helper which is used instead of a regular “link_to” helper when linking to a redtip.

link_to_redtip(name, id, html_options = {})

This is used if you already have an HTML element in your page (presumably hidden, but it doesn’t have to be) and you wish to use it for your redbox. Specify it by it’s id, and you’re in business. 

By default, the tip will appear below and left-aligned with the link that calls it. If you want to, you can offset this manually by calling it like this (for example):

link_to_redtip(name, id, :offsetLeft => -240, :offsetTop => 50)

The tip is 400px wide by default; you can change this in the css, but if you do, you may need to take a look at the clonePositionForTip method in redtip.js, as it uses the value of 400px (or so) to determine if the tip is going to spill outside the window, and automatically offsets it to the left if it is.

what bits of functionality are generic enough to be useful as a rails plugin. Releasing rails plugins is dead
simple, and helps us all do better work.
